CasTTY is a script for lecture recording and postprocessing.  It was
written in the duress of 2020.  When it breaks, you get to keep both
pieces.


WORKFLOW AND EXAMPLES
=====================

Workflow
--------

CasTTY includes commands to:

1. Record individual slides, or parts of slides.
2. Postprocess recorded files, including:
   - Transcoding,
   - Applying video overlays on a background slide,
   - Concatenating slides/parts,
   - And audio filtering.

Commands are run from the Common Lisp REPL, so it helps to have
multiple monitors. Most of the real work is done by FFmpeg.

Working Directory
-----------------

CasTTY operates relative to a working directory:

    (setq castty:*workdir* "/PATH/TO/STORE/MY/VIDEO/FILES")

Record
------

Record screen and audio quickly with minimal / fast compression.

* To record audio and video for a slide:

        (castty:record :number '(SLIDE-NUMBER SLIDE-PART) :video t :audio t)

* To record audio and take a screenshot:

        (castty:record :number '(SLIDE-NUMBER SLIDE-PART) :video :screenshot :audio t)

* To take a screenshot and not record audio:

        (castty:record :number '(SLIDE-NUMBER SLIDE-PART) :video :screenshot :audio nil)

* To record audio and no video or screenshot:

        (castty:record :number '(SLIDE-NUMBER SLIDE-PART) :video nil :audio t)


To end the recording run the `casttykill` script; it helps configure a
key binding in your window manager to call this script.

Video Overlays
--------------

CasTTY can overlay a separate video (and audio) on a captured slide.

1. Take a screenshot for the overlay background:

        (castty:record :number '(SLIDE-NUMBER SLIDE-PART) :video :background :audio nil)

2. Copy the video overlay into the `./src` directory.

The overlay will be constructed during postprocessing.

Postprocess
-----------

Postprocessing involves transcoding, overlay construction,
concatenation, and audio filtering.  The following command will
postprocess the recordings:

    (castty:post)

You can also postprocess from the shell with the following command, in
which case the current directory will be the working directory.

    $ castty post

Cleanup
-------

Remove all temporary and output files in the working directory:

    (castty:clean)

You can also clean from the shell with the following command, in
which case the current directory will be the working directory.

    $ castty clean

FILES
=====

Configuration
-------------

* `$HOME/.config/castty/scene-alist.lisp`: configuration file to set
  recording and output options.  See the `./lisp/scene-alist.lisp` in
  the source tree for an example.

Directories
-----------

Directories are relative to the working directory set in
`castty:*workdir*`.

* `./rec/`: Directory containing initial recordings
* `./src/`: Directory containing (lossless) transcoded recordings
* `./out/`: Directory containing output files
* `./tmp/`: Directory for Temporary working files

Temporary Files
---------------

* `/var/run/user/$UID/castty.pid`: PIDs of currently running recording
  processes.  The `casttykill` script stops a recording by killing
  each of these processes.

Output Files
------------

* `./out/hi-quality.mkv`: high-quality video file
* `./out/compressed.mp4`: compressed video file
